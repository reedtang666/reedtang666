# Hello there 👋

![](https://github.com/halfrost/halfrost/blob/master/icons/header_1.png)

Hi there, nice to meet you! 👋 I’m a passionate full-stack software engineer & entrepreneur with 10+ years of hands-on development experience, 4 years of computer science education, and a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications.
Previously an engineer at Huawei, I now lead a startup – blending corporate rigor with entrepreneurial agility to build scalable, user-centric solutions that bridge technology and real-world needs. 💻
🔧 Tech Stack & Core Strengths
Back-end: Go (core focus & major expertise) 🚀, PHP (years of practical experience), Java (proven track record with multiple projects), Python (my favorite language! – fully proficient, deeply passionate, and centered on AI/ML applications)
Front-end: Mastery of Flutter (current focus & advanced proficiency) 📱, JavaScript/Vue/React (solid production experience)
Infra & Emerging Tech: Exploring Rust & Solidity to expand technical breadth (aligning with recent focus on infrastructure)
AI Advocate: Die-hard GitHub Copilot fan 🤖 – leverage AI to supercharge development efficiency, and deeply invested in the future of AI-driven software innovation (a core pillar of my technical exploration)
🌱 Learning & Growth Journey
I’m a lifelong learner obsessed with blending technical depth, interdisciplinary wisdom, and forward-thinking vision:
Tech Focus: Deepening Linux expertise (synergizing with open-source passion), mastering Python for AI/ML, and exploring Rust & Solidity
Intellectual Pursuits: Diving into Math, Philosophy (for critical thinking), and soaking up insights from Elon Musk’s vision (a die-hard fan! 🚀)
Reading List:
Tech: 《Systems Performance 2nd Ed.》《BPF Performance Tools》(Infra & performance optimization)、《Python for Data Science Handbook》(AI/ML with my favorite language)
Wisdom: Philosophy classics、《Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future》(inspiration from visionary leadership)
🚀 Project & Mindset
Led 10+ large-scale projects (from corporate systems to startup products) – thriving on turning complex problems into elegant solutions. I believe in the power of AI to reshape software development, the value of open-source collaboration, and Elon Musk’s philosophy of “thinking in first principles” to challenge the status quo.
💻 Open-Source & Values
A devoted Linux enthusiast and open-source advocate 🐧 – I see Linux as more than an OS; it’s a philosophy of freedom, collaboration, and innovation that guides my work. I actively encourage and support open-source collaborations to build a more inclusive tech ecosystem.
🤝 Collaboration
Great software thrives on great teams & culture! I’m eager to collaborate with fellow passionate engineers, AI enthusiasts, and visionaries to build AI-augmented, high-impact products that push boundaries.
🎨 Beyond Coding
When I’m not debugging, building, or learning:
Hiking through nature 🏕️ & capturing landscapes with my camera 📸
Exploring local hidden-gem restaurants 🍴
Geeking out over Python AI advancements, Flutter updates, or Elon Musk’s latest innovations
Discussing philosophy, systems thinking, or open-source trends
Let’s harness technology, AI, and bold vision to create something amazing together – feel free to connect or fork a repo! 🚀
